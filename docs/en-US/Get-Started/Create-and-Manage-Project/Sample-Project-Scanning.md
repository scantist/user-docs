## Create Sample Project

Scantist provides sample projects for all the methods of scanning. The following steps below shows the screenshots and steps to start a sample project scan.

1. First, under projects from the left sidebar, under the create a new project selection, create a sample project.
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <img src="/images/Create-and-Manage-Project/create-project.png" />
  </div>

2. Choose the sample scan of the engine. Create it, and the scan will start automatically.
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <img src="/images/Create-and-Manage-Project/create-project2.png" />
  </div>

3. Notifications will be sent when the scan is completed, and can be viewed from the bell icon in the top right corner.
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <img src="/images/Create-and-Manage-Project/notification.png" />
  </div>
