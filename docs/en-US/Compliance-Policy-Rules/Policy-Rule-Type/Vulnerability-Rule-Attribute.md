> Define policies for vulnerabilities detected in your software projects

## Score

<hr class="thick" />

The rate of severity of a security vulnerability found in a component. The severity level is typically assigned by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), which rates vulnerabilities on a scale from 0 to 10, with 10 being the most severe. The CVSS score is calculated based on various factors such as the severity of the impact, the ease of exploitation, and the availability of a fix.

</div>

<div style="flex: 1; ">

<div style="color: #BF2600; font-weight: bold;">

You may want to deny any components that contains a vulnerability with a score of 7 or above

<div style="color: #006644; font-weight: bold;">

You may want to approve components with vulnerabilities that have a score of 5 or below

## Severity

<hr class="thick" />

The seriousness of a security vulnerability is categorized into levels such as low, medium, high and critical. The specific criteria for each level may vary depending on the vulnerability database or standard being used. Examples of severity ratings in the CVSS include:

&#x2022;0 - 3.9: Low 

&#x2022;4.0 - 6.9: Medium 

&#x2022;7.0 - 8.9: High

&#x2022;9.0 - 10.0: Critical

<div style="flex: 0.05; ">

&#10060;

</div>

<div style="flex: 1; ">

<div style="color: #BF2600; font-weight: bold;">

You may want to deny any components that contains a vulnerability with a critical and high severity level which may pose a significant threat to the system's security and may require immediate remediation

</div>

<div style="display: flex; background-color: #E3FCEF; margin-top: 10px">

<div style="flex: 0.05; ">

:white_check_mark:

</div>

<div style="flex: 1; ">

<div style="color: #006644; font-weight: bold;">

You may want to approve components with a low severity level which may have a minimal impact on the system

</div>

</div> 

</div>


## Vulnerability ID

<hr class="thick" />

A unique identifier assigned to a specific vulnerability that can be used to look up details about a specific vulnerability, including its severity, impact, and remediation steps.

<div style="flex: 0.05; ">

&#10060;

</div>

<div style="flex: 1; ">

<div style="color: #BF2600; font-weight: bold;">

You may want to deny Log4j components that have identified vulnerability

</div>

<span style="color: #BF2600;">

Example of Log4j vulnerabilities are CVE-2023-26464, CVE-2022-23307, CVE-2021-44832

</span>

</div> 

</div>


## Issue Type

<hr class="thick" />

Vulnerabilities can have different issue types that classify the nature of the vulnerability. You can crate a policy rule based on any of the issue types to either approve, deny or flag components that have vulnerabilities with the identified issue type. Examples of issues types include:

<div style="display: flex;">

<div style="flex: 1; text-align: center;">

<span>

**CVE**<br>
IDENTIFY PUBLICLY KNOWN VULNERABILITIES MAINTAINED BY THE [NATIONAL VULNERABILITY DATABASE](https://nvd.nist.gov/).

CVE IS USED TO UNIQUELY IDENTIFY A PARTICULAR VULNERABILITY ACROSS DIFFERENT INFORMATION SECURITY TOOLS<br>

</span>

</div>

<div style="flex: 1; text-align: center;">

<span>

**SECURITY BUG**<br>
IDENTIFY VULNERABILITIES DISCOVERED FROM PRIVATE SOURCES LIKE CHANGE-LOGS, BUG-TRACKERS AND SECURITY ADVISORIES<br>

</span>

</div>

<div style="flex: 1; text-align: center;">

<span>

**SECURITY WARNING**<br>
PARTIAL OR LOW-CONFIDENCE MATCHES FOR CVEs AND SECURITY BUGS FOUND DURING THE SCAN PROCESS

</span>

</div>

</div>

## Has Patched Version

<hr class="thick" />

You can create policy rules based on whether a vulnerability has a patched version available or not. 

<div style="display: flex; background-color: #FFEBE6;">

<div style="flex: 0.05; ">

&#10060;

</div>

<div style="flex: 1; ">

<div style="color: #BF2600; font-weight: bold;">

You may want to deny any components that has a vulnerability with no available patch

</div>

<span style="color: #BF2600;">

You can set the "Has Patched Version" attribute to "False" in the vulnerability rule

</span>

</div> 

</div>

## Suppress

<hr class="thick" />

You can suppress a vulnerability in your scanning results if the vulnerability does not pose a risk to your organization, or if you need more time to address the vulnerability. 

<div style="display: flex; background-color: #FFFAE6;">

<div style="flex: 0.05; ">

&#9888;

</div>

<div style="flex: 1; ">

<div style="color: #FF991F; font-weight: bold;">

You may want to flag any vulnerabilities that has been suppressed to review the security risks

</div>

<span style="color: #FF991F;">

You can set the "Suppress" attribute to "True" in the vulnerability rule

</span>

</div>
