  Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of merging in small code changes
  frequently - rather than merging in a large change at the end of a development
  cycle.

# Build-based Scan - CI/CD

The goal is to build healthier software by developing and testing in smaller increments. Hence, you can take advantage of the frequent development cycle, and you have an opportunity to ensure your application stays clean from known vulnerabilities and security bugs more frequently with each build and test.

Integrating Scantist SCA as part of your Continuous Integration (CI) system enables you to proactively manage the security and compliance risks that often accompany the use of open-source components â€“ a key milestone in implementing DevSecOps.
